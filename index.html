              Hello, my name is Nitin, and I am a dedicated game developer with a deep passion for creating immersive and 
              engaging games. With a rich background in software development and game design, I bring a unique blend of 
              technical expertise and creative vision to my projects.<br><br>
              Creating games is more than just a profession for me; It's a place where I discovered a lot about myself.<br><br>
              From the fear of missing out when your party decides to set out for an adventure to the feeling of emptiness when you complete the game you loved playing, 
                games invoke a range of emotions that you never knew existed. <b style="color: rgb(213, 47, 72);">Games have the power to transcend reality</b>. Is there a better way to 
                show your imaginations? <br><br>
                Game development is a very powerful tool and the responsibility lies in the hands of the developers to get in touch with the emotions of the players. I want players to feel the emotions I felt through my life and 
                want to make sure that each game I develop inspires creativity, resilience and a sense of wonder. Whether it's exploring a fantasy world, 
                solving intricate puzzles or overcoming obstacles, I want the players to feel a connection to the stories and the characters I've crafted.</span>

            I have worked as a software developer, building APIs, creating Windows applications, and managing databases. 
            This experience has been invaluable in my transition to game development. From designing architectures to 
            integrating APIs, I bring a wealth of knowledge to the game development process. I enjoy exploring new

                    goal is to survive and score as high as possible in this
                    thrilling chase through nature’s wonders. The game contains models
                    that were developed using primitive shapes and vertex positions.
                    There were also packages like FMOD, Bullet, Assimp that were integrated
                    for the sound, physics and managing assets respectively. The interesting
                    part was the development of fireflies that circle around the player
