              of emotions like happiness, sadness and anger, and when the
              player equips these emotions, he gets a unique ability. The levels
              also are a symbolic representation of emotional challenges,
              offering the experience mirroring the ups and downs of real life
              emotions. The code follows an event driven architecture making it

              that were developed using primitive shapes and vertex positions.
              There were also packages like FMOD, Bullet, Assimp that were integrated
              for the sound, physics and managing assets respectively. The interesting

                show the explosion effect of the car when it hits any obstacles in its path. There is 
                also a TV that displays the whole race, which is done with the help of Frame Buffer 
                Objects. The whole game is completely customizable and is a solid foundation to build upon.

              <p class="card-text">Inside ADHD is a VR experience that aims to immerse users in the daily life of 
                an individual living with ADHD. The protagonist’s environment is filled with objects that reflect 
                their life and challenges. The player's phone plays a major role on providing updates on what is going 
                on. It is one of the Diegetic Interfaces where you can get calls specifying the tasks to remember, and 
                it also contains the path to get to your objective. For a personal touch, I found it interesting to add 
                a game that the player can play on their phone. The challenging part was rendering what the player is 
                currently looking at, turning it into a video and playing it on the screen on loop. This symbolizes that although the 
                environment has changed, the player cannot stop thinking about it. The whole virtual world is built to react 
                to the user’s actions and progresses the narrative based on their interactions.</p>

                features. After the features are extracted, a CNN model is defined using the Keras library which is a part of TensorFlow.
                The model is designed for a task involving sequential or temporal data, such as audio classification, with an output 
                layer indicating 8 different classes representing 8 different emotions. This model was trained on the extracted features

              <p class="card-text">This tweet application utilizes Kafka, Service Bus, and MongoDB within an 
                MVC architecture. Users interact with the frontend to post and view tweets, which are handled 
                by the backend controllers. Tweets are stored in MongoDB, while Kafka manages real-time data 
                processing by producing and consuming messages for tasks like analytics and notifications. 
                Service Bus facilitates communication between microservices, such as sending notifications 
                when new tweets are posted. This architecture ensures scalability, decoupling, and efficient 
                real-time handling of data and interactions.</p>

                the authenticity of the user. All of the patient and user details are stored in the MongoDB database.
                This application was developed in a Docker environment and was hosted on Microsoft Azure.</p>

              <p class="card-text">This project's primary aim is to develop a mathematical model for predicting the wear of
                graphene oxide-based polymer matrix composites. The mechanical and physical properties of the
                composites were examined using ASTM specifications. Two models were created, one 
                using ANN and the other using ANFIS. These models reduce the time and effort required to discover 
                appropriate wear for each composition and arrive at the most efficient option. Both algorithms 
                were able to forecast wear with a 90% accuracy rate.</p>
